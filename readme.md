KeyClean Companion is an interactive web-based utility designed to make the process of cleaning your mechanical keyboard fun and efficient. By tracking key presses and visualizing them on-screen, it ensures no key goes unnoticed during your cleaning routine.

## Features
- **Real-Time Key Tracking**: Displays the key you press along with its code and count in a clean, minimal interface.
- **Watermark Effect**: Visualize key activity with a dynamic, rotating background watermark.

- **Enhanced Experience**: Blocks unintended `PrintScreen` usage and prevents text selection for distraction-free usage.
